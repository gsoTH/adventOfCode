# The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).
#
# A Y
# B X
# C Z
#
# This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:
#   In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).
#   In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).
#   The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.
# In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).

# What would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?

# Key:
#   A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors
#   X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors
# Points:
#   1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors
#   0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won
